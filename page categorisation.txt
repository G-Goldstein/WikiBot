Read through all pages that are not redirects (This ignores templates, categories and files)

For each page:
	If it's already in one of the categories we're after, do nothing. Otherwise...
	Get the contributor and timestamp of the most recent non-minor revision.
	If the most recent non-minor revision was over five years ago, mark the page for deletion. This gives users two months to unflag it before it's due for deletion. Otherwise...
	Look at the area of the contributor and assign the 'Template:Page ownership' template to that page, with the area set to match the user's area. Also specify 'review=yes' on the template, so that this page goes into the review category.
	If the user's area isn't known or isn't one of the people we've found, or there are no non-minor edits, we instead put the page in 'Category:Page ownership unknown'
